# Coupling DynEarthSol with GoSPL

This tutorial explains how to run DynEarthSol coupled with **GoSPL** (Global Scalable Paleo Landscape Evolution) to simulate the interaction between tectonic deformation and surface processes like erosion and sediment transport.

## What is GoSPL?

[GoSPL](https://github.com/Geodels/gospl) is a Python-based landscape evolution model that simulates:
- River incision and sediment transport
- Hillslope diffusion
- Marine deposition
- Flexural isostasy

When coupled with DynEarthSol, you can study how tectonic processes (uplift, extension, compression) interact with surface erosion over geological timescales.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ✅ GoSPL installed through conda. 
- ✅ `gospl_extensions`
- ✅ DynEarthSol compiled with GoSPL support

### Install GoSPL through conda
Recommended by GoSPL users. Refer to https://gospl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installConda.html.

### Install gospl_extensions
```
git clone https://github.com/GeoFLAC/gospl_extensions.git
cd gospl_extensions/cpp_interface
make install-local
```
:::tip Check your build
You will see this message if successful:
```
Installing locally for DynEarthSol integration...
✅ Installed locally to gospl_extensions/lib and gospl_extensions/include
```
:::

### Build DynEarthSol with GoSPL support

1. Set `use_gospl = 1` in Makefile.
2. Set `GOSPL_EXT_DIR`: e.g., `GOSPL_EXT_DIR = $(HOME)/opt/gospl_extensions`
3. Run `make`.

:::tip Check your build
When the build is successful, you should see the following message:
```
==============================================
✅ DynEarthSol built with GoSPL support!
==============================================
🚀 To run with GoSPL support:

Use the wrapper script (PYTHONPATH is set automatically):
  ./dynearthsol-gospl your_input.cfg

Or set PYTHONPATH manually and use the regular executable:
  PYTHONPATH=/home/auser/opt/gospl_extensions/cpp_interface:$PYTHONPATH ./dynearthsol3d your_input.cfg
==============================================
```

## How coupling works

DES3D and GoSPL exchange data following the **ASPECT-FastScape simple
coupling scheme**:

1. **DES → GoSPL:** At each coupling event, DES passes time-averaged
   surface velocities (Δcoord/Δt over the coupling interval) to GoSPL.
   Time-averaging filters out quasi-dynamic inertial oscillations that
   would otherwise perturb GoSPL's drainage network.
2. **GoSPL → DES:** GoSPL runs its landscape evolution (river incision,
   hillslope diffusion, marine deposition) and returns elevation
   increments Δh at every surface node.
3. **Tectonic uplift accounting:** DES strips its own Lagrangian
   vertical displacement from Δh before applying it, preventing
   double-counting with GoSPL's erosion signal.
4. **Persistent drainage state:** GoSPL's river network state is
   preserved across DES remeshing events so that drainage divides are
   not reset after mesh adaptation.
5. **Padded GoSPL mesh:** The GoSPL mesh extends beyond the DES domain
   by a configurable padding fraction (`gospl_mesh_padding`, default
   0.1) to avoid edge artifacts during extension.

```
DES3D ──── surface velocities (Δcoord/Δt) ────► GoSPL
  ▲                                                │
  └────── elevation increments (Δh − uplift) ─────┘
```

### Coupling modes

| `gospl_coupling_mode` | Trigger parameter | Meaning |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `steps` (default) | `gospl_coupling_frequency` | GoSPL runs every N DES steps |
| `time` | `gospl_coupling_interval_in_yr` | GoSPL runs every T model years |

### Known limitations

- **The coupling interval is a trigger, not a clamp.** In `time` mode,
  `gospl_coupling_interval_in_yr` only decides *when* coupling fires. The
  `dt` handed to GoSPL is the time accumulated since the last event, so if
  DES's adaptive time step exceeds the interval, coupling fires every DES
  step and GoSPL's step silently becomes DES's `dt`. There is no
  sub-stepping or truncation back to the nominal interval.
- **Remeshing between coupling events.** The coupling clock is unaffected
  by remeshing, and GoSPL's elevation state is not re-seeded from DES
  afterwards (GoSPL owns the topography). However, the time-averaged
  velocity only guards against a change in the *number* of surface nodes
  across a remesh. If a remesh leaves that count unchanged (common when
  only the interior remeshes), node identity is not verified and the
  velocity for the next coupling event can difference unrelated nodes.
  Treat the first coupling event after a remesh with caution.
- **The GoSPL mesh is fixed at startup.** It is generated once, sized to the
  DES model's *initial* top surface plus `gospl_mesh_padding` on each side,
  and never regenerated (on restart an existing mesh file is reused as is).
  The padding fraction therefore bounds how much lateral extension the DES
  model can accumulate before its surface approaches the GoSPL mesh
  boundary, where edge artifacts can reappear. Nothing warns you when this
  happens, so choose a generous `gospl_mesh_padding` for strongly extensional
  models.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Enable GoSPL in your configuration

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `surface_process_option` | 0 | Set to **11** to enable GoSPL |
| `surface_process_gospl_config_file` | — | Path to your GoSPL YAML file |
| `gospl_coupling_mode` | `steps` | `steps` or `time` — controls what the coupling interval means |
| `gospl_coupling_frequency` | 1 | GoSPL runs every N DES steps (used when `gospl_coupling_mode = steps`) |
| `gospl_coupling_interval_in_yr` | — | GoSPL runs every T model years (used when `gospl_coupling_mode = time`) |
| `gospl_velocity_coupling` | `true` | Pass surface velocities to GoSPL for smoother drainage-network evolution |
| `gospl_mesh_resolution` | -1 | GoSPL grid spacing in meters (-1 = automatic) |
| `gospl_mesh_padding` | 0.1 | Fractional domain padding for GoSPL mesh (avoids boundary artifacts) |
| `gospl_initial_topo_amplitude` | 0.0 | Initial random topography (m) |
| `gospl_mesh_perturbation` | 0.3 | Grid randomization (0–1) |

:::info Coupling frequency tip
For models with slow erosion rates, you can set `gospl_coupling_frequency = 100` or higher to speed up computation. GoSPL will run less often but with accumulated time. Alternatively, use `gospl_coupling_mode = time` to couple at fixed model-time intervals regardless of step size.
:::

```cfg title="my_simulation.cfg"
[control]
surface_process_option = 11
surface_process_gospl_config_file = gospl_config.yml
gospl_coupling_mode = steps
gospl_coupling_frequency = 100      # Run GoSPL every 100th DynEarthSol time step
gospl_velocity_coupling = true      # Pass surface velocities to GoSPL
gospl_mesh_resolution = 500         # in meters
gospl_mesh_padding = 0.1            # extend GoSPL mesh 10 % beyond DES domain
gospl_initial_topo_amplitude = 0.0  # in meters. 0.0: initially flat
gospl_mesh_perturbation = 0.3       # 30 % of random perturbations, +0.5/-0.5 x h
```

### Step 2: Create a GoSPL configuration file

Create a YAML file for GoSPL settings:

```yaml title="gospl_config.yml"
name: coupled_simulation

domain:
    npdata: ['./gospl_mesh','v','c','z']
    flowdir: 1
    seadepo: False
    bc: '1000'

output:
    dir: 'coupling_test' # Output directory

time:
  start: 0.0
  end: 1000000.0   # 1 Myr
  tout: 5000.0     # 5 kyr output interval
  dt: 1000.0       # 1 kyr time step (to be overwritten by DynEarthSol)

spl:
    K: 4.e-6
    d: 0.
    m: 0.4

diffusion:
    hillslopeKa: 0.2
    hillslopeKm: 1.0

sea:
    position: -10.

climate:
  - start: 0.
    uniform: 1
```

### Step 3: Run your simulation

```bash
./dynearthsol-gospl my_simulation.cfg
```

DynEarthSol will automatically:
1. Generate a mesh for GoSPL at startup
2. Exchange elevation data between the two models
3. Apply erosion/deposition changes to the DynEarthSol surface

In this example, 
- the mesh is generated automatically and saved as `gospl_mesh.npz` in your working directory.
- DynEarthSol outputs will be saved in the working directory.
- GoSPL outputs will be saved in the `coupling_test` directory. 

## Example: Extensional Basin with Erosion

TBA.


## Troubleshooting

### "GoSPL not initialized" error

**Cause:** GoSPL Python package not found.

**Solution:** Ensure GoSPL is installed:
```bash
pip install gospl
```

### "Cannot find gospl_config.yml"

**Cause:** Configuration file path is incorrect.

**Solution:** Use an absolute path or ensure the file is in your working directory:
```cfg
surface_process_gospl_config_file = /full/path/to/gospl_config.yml
```

### Simulation runs slowly

**Cause:** GoSPL is being called every time step.

**Solution:** Increase the coupling frequency:
```cfg
gospl_coupling_frequency = 200
```
